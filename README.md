Dispatchers? If you chose national parks, are you interested in visitors? Park rangers? Try not to build one thing for _everyone_ -- that usually leads to a product that is not very useful for anyone.

**What users could do with this information** -- Make a list of the particular decisions you want to enable with your dashboard. This can be a blue-sky list, but you will likely end up refining your scope later.

**Data needed to enable the above** -- You should use this list of decisions you want to enable to evaluate any dataset or interactive element you add to your dashboard, to determine whether it actually supports making those decisions. Whatever data you use, **be sure to include citations somewhere in your app interface**.
